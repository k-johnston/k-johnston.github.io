        <p>My background: I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona &#40;yes, it&rsquo;s a dry heat	&#41;. I studied the humanities at Arizona State University, where I learned to translate Augustan literature from the original Latin, to analyze texts critically and find patterns that revealed deeper truths, to run a student research journal, and to see the systems behind the political world. I then got a Master&rsquo;s in Publishing and Writing at Emerson College, where I first learned about project management and digital publishing. I coded many ebooks, and my epiphany there is that ebooks at the time were basically websites from the 1990s with fewer blink tags. I also got my first exposures to metadata and database management through internships at local academic presses. I then moved to the Bay Area and got a job in the digital publishing industry, where I furthered my interest in project management and digital publishing. I moved to Europe for the opportunity to live, work, and travel there for several years: first in Basel, Switzerland and then in Cologne, Germany. While I was there, I delved into learning German and more technical skills. Spending time in the classroom &#40;when not exploring new countries	&#41; gave me the time to develop passion projects.</p>
        <p>My &ldquo;Imprint&rdquo;: I love books, both physical and digital versions. Both are real! While there is still validity in the traditional formats of books &#40;I love novels and find textbooks to be key in the way that I learn	&#41;, I am interested in seeing if we can create new formats. What if we brought books to the web in new and interesting ways? What if experiences were customized for the book? What would mimic opening and closing a book online? I have either written original material or taken it from Project Gutenberg and build some fun code around the book to have unique reading experiences. My interest is in formats and structure.</p>

          <li>Six stories</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Worterschatz project? Funf Cs of Arizona into some sort of image picture book?</p>
        <p>What I bring to the table: Strong background in digital publishing. Flexibility and can-do attitude. Resilience. Potential.</p>
        <p>My professional goals: I love books, but I want to see them reflect our lives better: more phones, more texts, more social media. I like the intersection of these two worlds and want to be a part of it. I think the best way is either in a project management or front-end development role. I get excited when things work out and problems are solved.</p>
        <p>Some fun facts: I once lived near two castles. My favorite color is navy. I have a cat named Felix who is my best Instagram model.</p>
